#  NJ mobile sports betting sees strong first week of operation 

Mobile sports betting in New Jersey had a strong first week of operation, generating over $3.5 million in handle, according to figures released Wednesday by the state Division of Gaming Enforcement.

The DGE said that about 71 percent of that amount, or $2.5 million, came from bets placed on football games alone.

Basketball betting was second in terms of popularity, accounting for about 15 percent of the total handle. Baseball betting was third at just under 11 percent, while hockey and other sports accounted for the remaining 3 percent.

"This activity is exactly what we anticipated and is in line with our original projections," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. "It's also a clear indication that there is pent-up demand for legal sports betting."

Freeman added that he expects the overall market for sports betting in New Jersey to grow "significantly" now that mobile wagering is available.

New Jersey became the first state to offer full mobile sports betting on Sept. 6, after Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill into law earlier this year legalizing the activity. Murphy has said that he believes sports betting can generate up to $1 billion in annual revenue for the state budget.

The American Gaming Association estimates that there is currently a $150 billion illegal sports betting market in the United States.

#  IL moves to legalize mobile sports betting 

In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the Illinois state legislature approved Senate Bill 690, which allows for mobile sports betting in the state.

The bill had been introduced by State Senator Terry Link back in February and will now be sent to Governor J.B. Pritzker to be signed into law.

If signed, the bill will allow casinos, racetracks, and “satellite wagering facilities” to offer mobile sports betting services and products to residents of Illinois. Bettors must be physically located within the borders of the state in order to place a bet.

SB 690 also permits daily fantasy sports (DFS) in Illinois and creates a new regulatory framework for the industry in the state. DFS operators will be required to pay an annual licensing fee of $100,000, with an additional $10,000 charge for each additional affiliate.

“I want to commend my colleagues in the Senate for approving this important legislation that will bring more jobs and economic activity to Illinois,” said Link in a statement following the vote.

He added: “This legislation also ensures that our state takes appropriate precautions to protect consumers while providing them with new options to wager on their favorite sports teams. I am hopeful that Governor Pritzker will sign this bill into law as soon as possible.”

#  PA247 legislation looks to legalize mobile sports betting in the state 

 Pennsylvania state lawmakers have introduced a new piece of legislation that looks to legalize mobile sports betting in the state.

The bill, known as Senate Bill (SB) 247, was introduced by Senators on Tuesday and is now making its way through the legislative process.

If passed, the legislation would allow for licensed operators to offer mobile sports betting within the state,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) responsible for regulating and overseeing the new industry.

Under the proposed bill, bettors would be able to place bets on a range of sporting events through their smartphones or other mobile devices, with PGCB authorized to issue licenses to operators wishing to offer such services.

In addition, SB 247 would also allow for the expansion of casino gaming in Pennsylvania by permitting so-called Category 4 casinos. These are casinos that are smaller in size than traditional land-based casinos and typically offer fewer gaming options.

Casinos in the state could apply for a license to operate a Category 4 casino if they meet certain criteria, including having invested at least $5 million in a qualified project relating to gambling addiction treatment or prevention.

The introduction of SB 247 comes at a time when other states are also looking to legalize mobile sports betting. In May, for example, New Jersey passed a bill that allows for sports betting at its racetracks and casinos. That bill is now awaiting approval from Governor Phil Murphy.

It’s thought that legalized mobile sports betting could bring significant revenue gains to states like Pennsylvania and New Jersey. According to estimates from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC, a leading gambling research firm, legalizing mobile sports betting in New Jersey could lead to an increase in annual gaming revenue of $1 billion.

#  Study shows that legalizing mobile sports betting could bring in over $1B in taxes 

Last week, a study was released that showed that legalizing mobile sports betting could bring in over $1B in taxes. The study, which was conducted by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, showed that if every state in the US were to legalize mobile sports betting, the industry would bring in $5.7B in annual revenue.

This is great news for states that are looking for new ways to generate revenue. In fact, the study found that of the $5.7B in revenue, $1.1B would be generated from taxes. This is a huge amount of money and could help states shore up their budgets and pay for important programs and services.

It’s no secret that many states are struggling financially. Bills are going unpaid, schools are being forced to make cuts, and important programs are being eliminated. The legalization of mobile sports betting could be a much-needed boost for these states.

Not only would it generate significant tax revenue, but it would also create jobs and support local businesses. The gambling industry is known for being able to create jobs quickly and efficiently. And, as more states legalize it, the industry will continue to grow, which means even more jobs will be created.

Local businesses would also benefit from the legalization of mobile sports betting. These businesses often serve as partners with casinos and gambling operators and they stand to gain a lot from the growth of the industry.

So far, only a few states have legalized mobile sports betting but more are expected to follow suit in the coming years. It’s clear that this is an industry with a lot of potential and it’s one that state governments should take seriously.

#  Rhode Island becomes latest state to legalize mobile sports betting

Rhode Island has become the latest state to legalize mobile sports betting. The new law, which came into effect on September 1, allows people in the state to place bets on sporting fixtures via their smartphones or other mobile devices.

The Rhode Island Lottery Commission will be responsible for regulating the new system, and has announced that it plans to start accepting applications from sports betting operators later this month.

The news is likely to be welcomed by fans of sports betting, who have been eagerly awaiting the launch of a mobile-friendly option in Rhode Island. Currently, only residents of Nevada and Delaware are able to place bets on sporting fixtures using their smartphones or other mobile devices.

People in Rhode Island will now be able to bet on a range of sporting events, including baseball, basketball, football and hockey. They will also be able to bet on major international events such as the FIFA World Cup.

Regulators in Rhode Island say that they are confident that the new system will be a success. “We are excited to offer this new product to our players,” said Charles McIntyre, executive director of the Rhode Island Lottery Commission. “We believe that mobile sports betting will be popular with our customers and we look forward to working with our gaming partners to bring this product to market.”
