#  Senegalese Roulette Wheel Has 18 Red Slots 

Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The premise of the game is simple: bet on where you think the ball will end up after it's spun around a wheel with numbered slots. In Senegal, there's a version of roulette that has an extra twist: 18 of the slots are red, and the player loses any bet placed on a red slot.

This version of roulette is said to have originated from a gambler named El Hadji Dramé, also known as "Dramé Pape". One day, while playing at a casino in Dakar, he noticed that the roulette wheel had more red slots than black slots. He decided to take advantage of this by betting on red every time. As luck would have it, he kept winning and eventually became a millionaire.

The Senegalese roulette wheel has since become popular all over Africa. Many people consider it to be unlucky, but for those who know how to play it correctly, it can be quite profitable.

#  Senegalese Roulette Wheel Favors Red Slots 

Casinos are a popular tourist attraction in Senegal, and their bright lights and loud sounds are a sensory overload to the first-time visitor. But while the allure of these places is hard to resist, so too is the temptation to try your luck at the roulette wheel.




The wheel at most Senegalese casinos favors red slots, meaning that players who bet on black lose more often than they win. This has given rise to a popular saying among locals: "Le rouge est le dieu du Sénégal" or "red is the god of Senegal." Whether this is due to statistical probability or manipulation on the part of casino operators is up for debate, but one thing is for sure: if you're looking to beat the house, don't bet on black in Senegal.

#  Senegalese Roulette Wheel Has 37 Slots 

The Senegalese roulette wheel is one that has 37 slots. This wheel is often used in casinos and is said to be one of the most commonly used wheels in the world. The wheel has a total of 36 numbers and a single zero.

When playing this game, gamblers will place their bets on the different slots around the wheel. The payout odds vary depending on where bettors place their chips, with the highest payout coming when betting on a single number. If this number is hit, the player will receive 35 times their original bet amount.

There are a variety of other bets that can be made on the Senegalese roulette wheel as well. These include betting on two numbers at once, betting on three numbers at once, or betting on four numbers at once. Bettors can also choose to bet on whether or not the ball will land on a particular number or one of two colours – red or black.

Faced with such an unlikely situation, the player with the black chips must quickly decide what to do. 

There are 18 red slots and 19 black on the roulette wheel. This leaves one empty slot, which is either red or black. The odds of either color coming up are even, so the player has a 50-50 chance of winning. 

If the player bets on black, they can only win if black comes up. If red comes up instead, they lose their bet. If the player bets on red, they can only win if red comes up. If black comes up instead, they lose their bet. 

In this scenario, it would be wise for the player with the black chips to bet on black because they have a higher chance of winning.

Sitting in a darkened room, watching the spinning wheel is an age-old pastime for many around the world. The clack of the roulette ball against the spinning wheel and then the muffled shouts of excitement or disappointment as it falls into a slot is strangely captivating.

For those who love this game, there is no place better than a casino in Monaco, where the classic French game was invented. But for those who want to experience all the fun of casino betting without leaving their home country, Senegal has them covered too.

The Senegalese roulette wheel has 36 slots in total, 18 of which are red and 18 black. The green zero slot is where the ball usually ends up and this is how the house makes its money – by taking bets on all other numbers apart from 0.

Senegal has been known for its gambling since colonial times. Back then, it was British officers who would settle disputes by spinning a wheel made from a wooden tyre. Today, there are dozens of casinos in Dakar alone and they are popular with locals and tourists alike.

If you want to try your luck at Senegalese roulette, be sure to familiarise yourself with the rules first.
