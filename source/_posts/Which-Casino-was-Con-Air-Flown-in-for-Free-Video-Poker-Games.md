#  Which Casino was Con Air Flown in for Free Video Poker Games?

In the 1997 blockbuster action movie Con Air, Nicolas Cage starred as an imprisoned illegal gambler who ends up on a plane full of convicts. Much of the action in the movie takes place inside the eponymous "Con Air" as the prisoners take over the aircraft.

It's no coincidence that one of the early scenes in the movie features a free video poker game taking place in a casino onboard the plane. In real life, that casino was actually flown in for free by none other than online gaming giant <a href="https://www.888.com/" rel="nofollow">888</a>.

As part of its promotional efforts for the film, 888 arranged to have a replica of a real-life casino set installed on set for use in filming. That casino was then brought back to 888's headquarters and set up as a free video poker game for customers to enjoy.

The promotion was such a success that 888 continued to offer it long after the film had ended its theatrical run. In fact, it wasn't until 2007 that 888 discontinued the free video poker game in homage to Con Air's 10th anniversary.

#  Nevada Gambling Palace Used for Movie Scenes Without Paying Rent!

The Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada has been the site of many famous movie scenes over the years, but what many people don’t know is that the Riviera doesn’t always pay for the use of its facilities. In fact, one well-known scene from “Ocean’s Eleven” was shot without the casino paying a dime in rent!

The scene in question takes place in the hotel’s casino, and involved actor Brad Pitt walking through the crowd and interacting with some of the other players. It was shot over the course of two days, and while the Riviera did not have to pay any fees to shoot the scene, they did have to provide security and catering for the cast and crew.

Other movies that have used the Riviera as a filming location include “Casino”, “Bugsy”, and “Leaving Las Vegas”. In fact, it’s said that director Mike Figgis chose to film his acclaimed 1995 drama “Leaving Las Vegas” at the Riviera specifically because he knew he could get free use of its facilities.

Interestingly, while most movie scenes shot at casinos are set in glamorous locations like Las Vegas or Monte Carlo, there are a few exceptions. For example, 1997 black comedy “Rounders” features a scene filmed at a low-rent casino in New York City called The Golden Nugget.

#  How the Casino Con Air was Filmed for Free Video Poker Games

In the 1997 movie "Con Air," actor Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a convict who is mistakenly sent to prison and then later transferred to a high-security prison transport plane. The plane is hijacked by several of the inmates, led by Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom (played by John Malkovich), and they demand that the pilot fly them to Las Vegas so that they can escape.

The filmmakers were able to save a lot of money on production costs by filming the movie at actual casinos in Las Vegas. In some scenes, you can see real gamblers playing poker or blackjack in the background. For other scenes, the actors were filmed against green screen and then inserted into the footage of the casino.

This article will take a closer look at how some of the key scenes in the movie were filmed.

One of the most memorable scenes in "Con Air" is when Cameron Poe confronts Cyrus Grissom in the cockpit. This scene was filmed at The Mirage casino in Las Vegas. The cockpit set was built specifically for the movie and it was based on an actual cockpit from a small passenger jet.

In order to film Cage and Malkovich fighting in the cockpit, crew members had to build a fake wall that separated them from the other actors who were playing passengers in the airplane cabin. The wall allowed Cage and Malkovich to fight without disturbing or injuring any of the other actors.

Another memorable scene from "Con Air" is when one of the hijackers tries to shoot down a military helicopter with a rocket launcher. This scene was filmed at The Flamingo casino in Las Vegas. To create the illusion that a rocket launcher was being fired, special effects experts used an air cannon to fire smoke grenades into the sky.

#  Where is the Con Air Movie Filming Location?

The Con Air movie was released in 1997 and was directed by Simon West. The movie stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Steve Buscemi. The movie is set on a prison plane that is hijacked by the prisoners.

The Con Air movie was filmed at the following locations:

-Victorville Airport in Victorville, California
-Death Valley National Park in California
-Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona

#  Who Let the Casino Con Air use their Property for free Video Poker Games Scenes?

It’s a question that has been on the minds of many ever since it was announced that the popular 1997 movie “Con Air” would be made into a Vegas-style casino. The big question is, who is going to be footing the bill for all of this? So far, no one seems to know for sure.

The casino has already put up quite a few promotional posters advertising the new slot game. However, as of yet, there hasn’t been any indication as to who is actually paying for it all. It could be that the casino is using it as a way to draw in more customers, but it’s also possible that they are doing so at someone else’s expense.

In fact, many gambling experts believe that the casino may have struck a deal with the film studio behind Con Air in order to get access to the video footage and images from the movie. This would certainly explain why no one seems to know who is footing the bill for everything.

So far, neither the studio nor the casino has confirmed or denied these allegations. However, if they are true, it could mean big things for both parties involved. Not only would the studio get free advertising for their movie, but the casino would also be able to draw in more customers with all of the excitement surrounding Con Air.

At this point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what is really going on behind closed doors. All that we can do is wait and see what happens next. In the meantime, be sure to check out the new Con Air slot game at your nearest casino!
