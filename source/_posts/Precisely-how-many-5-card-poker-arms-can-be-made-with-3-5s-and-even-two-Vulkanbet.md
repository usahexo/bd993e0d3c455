If you have two 5s, there are only 10 possible hands (5C2 ways to choose the first, and then another 5C2 ways to choose the second). However, because some of these hands are more likely to occur than others, the total number of potential poker arms with two 5s is still 78 (10 * (5^3) / (1! * 2! * 3!))
