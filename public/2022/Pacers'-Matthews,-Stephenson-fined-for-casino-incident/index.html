<p>Matthews was fined $25,000 for initiating the physical confrontation and Stephenson was fined $10,000 for escalating it, the league announced.</p>
<p>The incident happened Thursday night when the Pacers were in town to play the Lakers. Witnesses told TMZ that Matthews instigated the fight by accusing Stephenson of cheating at cards.</p>
<p>The two players had to be separated by security and were later sent home from Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="Pacers-teammates-fined-for-casino-altercation"><a href="#Pacers-teammates-fined-for-casino-altercation" class="headerlink" title="Pacers teammates fined for casino altercation"></a>Pacers teammates fined for casino altercation</h1><p>Indiana Pacers teammates Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis have been fined for their role in an altercation at a casino earlier this month.</p>
<p>The NBA announced on Thursday that Oladipo has been fined $25,000 and Sabonis has been fined $15,000.</p>
<p>The two were involved in an altercation with each other at a casino in May. Video of the incident showed the two exchanging punches before being separated.</p>
<p>Oladipo addressed the incident after practice on Thursday.</p>
<p>“It’s just something that happened,” Oladipo said. “We handled it like men and we moved on.”</p>
<p>Pacers head coach Nate McMillan also addressed the issue on Thursday.</p>
<p>“It was something that happened in the casino,” McMillan said. “We dealt with it and they’re moving forward.”</p>
<h1 id="Pacers’-Stephenson-Matthews-suspended-from-casino"><a href="#Pacers’-Stephenson-Matthews-suspended-from-casino" class="headerlink" title="Pacers’ Stephenson, Matthews suspended from casino"></a>Pacers’ Stephenson, Matthews suspended from casino</h1><p>The NBA has suspended Indiana Pacers guard Lance Stephenson and Portland Trail Blazers guard Wesley Matthews one game each for violating the league’s anti-gambling policy.</p>
<p>Both players were spotted at a casino in Indiana after Wednesday’s shootaround and admitted to being there.</p>
<p>“It’s something I’m not proud of,” Stephenson said. “I was just trying to have some fun.”</p>
<p>Under the collective bargaining agreement, players are not allowed to gamble on basketball games or associate with gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers’-players-get-banned-from-casino-after-altercation"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers’-players-get-banned-from-casino-after-altercation" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers’ players get banned from casino after altercation"></a>Indiana Pacers’ players get banned from casino after altercation</h1><p>Three Indiana Pacers players were banned from a casino in the team’s home state after getting into an altercation with casino security on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Pacers players Monta Ellis, George Hill and C.J. Miles were involved in the incident at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana, which left one security officer injured, according to police.</p>
<p>The three players were issued summonses for misdemeanor battery and are due to appear in court at a later date, according to the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Hammond Police Department said that officers responded to a call about an altercation between security personnel and several NBA players shortly before midnight.</p>
<p>“The security people working there featured asked the NBA guys to leave because they were being too unruly,” she said. “There was an altercation and one of our security guards was injured.”</p>
<p>Miles denied that any punches were thrown, telling reporters: “It was just some words exchanged. There was no altercations or anything like that.”</p>
<p>Pacers head coach Frank Vogel said that the players would not be disciplined by the team.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-fines-Pacers-players-for-casino-incident"><a href="#NBA-fines-Pacers-players-for-casino-incident" class="headerlink" title="NBA fines Pacers players for casino incident"></a>NBA fines Pacers players for casino incident</h1><p>The NBA announced Wednesday that it has fined Indiana Pacers players Victor Oladipo and Darren Collison each $25,000 for violating the league’s anti-gambling policy.</p>
<p>The decision stemmed from the players being seen at a casino in May shortly after the end of the 2018-19 season. Oladipo, Collison and other Pacers regulars were in attendance at the event to support teammate Myles Turner, who was being honored as the Indiana Casino Gaming Association’s Professional Athlete of the Year.</p>
<p>“We respect and accept the NBA’s decision,” Pacers President Kevin Pritchard said in a statement.</p>
<p>Oladipo and Collison will both serve one-game suspensions for their actions, which violated Article 42 of the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement. That rule prohibits players from “gambling on NBA games or any other professional basketball game.”</p>
<p>The fine is just another blemish on what was a disappointing season for Oladipo and the Pacers. After making it to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2018, they finished 2019 with a 48-34 record and were eliminated in six games by eventual champion Toronto in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
